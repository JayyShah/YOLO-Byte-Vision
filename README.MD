# Object Detection, Tracking, and Counting with YOLOv8, ByteTrack, and SuperVision

# Overview:

- Welcome to the Object Detection, Tracking, and Counting project! This project leverages the power of YOLOv8 for object detection, ByteTrack for tracking, and SuperVision for counting. These cutting-edge technologies combine to provide a comprehensive solution for a wide range of applications, from security surveillance to retail analytics.

# Introduction
- This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for object detection, tracking, and counting. It combines state-of-the-art models for each of these tasks:

- YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once Version 8): YOLO is a real-time object detection system. YOLOv8 is the latest iteration, known for its speed and accuracy in identifying objects within images and videos.

- ByteTrack: ByteTrack is used for tracking objects across frames, ensuring continuous monitoring and tracking of objects even in complex scenarios.

- SuperVision: SuperVision helps in counting objects accurately within a frame. It's an invaluable tool for applications such as people counting in retail stores or vehicles on a road.
